# SignUpFactory

## What's it ?

It's an application where you can register and see the profile of other registered members.

It also allows you to enrich your profile with a photo to make other members jealous!

## How to build it ?

First you will have to install the environment for React Native.

To do this, simply follow the instructions here :

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.

Make sure to follow all the instructions using Expo, not React Native CLI.

For Node, I recommend to use NVM if possible, because it's more flexible, as described here :

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.

Once you're setup, clone the repository. By default the "develop" branch will be used.

Install the npm packages using :

`npm install`

Finaly, start the build using :

- For iOS devices :

`npm run ios`

- For Android devices :

`npm run android`

Additional installation may be required if you didn't have Expo yet.

Well played, it should work now !

## How to deploy it ?

To deploy, just use the expo publishing feature. Make sure to use it only on "develop" with a tested code.

The iOS and Android applications are available [here](https://expo.io/@yungkittty/SignUpFactory).
